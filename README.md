## Project Overview:
## Project Name: 
atlan-fe-task-project

## Technology Stack:
Framework: React Next JS

## Description:
This project is a web-based SQL query execution application developed using React. It provides users with a platform to input and execute SQL queries, displaying the results in a structured format. The application supports multiple predefined queries, each accompanied by its corresponding table of data.

## Performance Metrics:
Initial Load Time: Measured using browser developer tools.
Re-render Time: Recorded during and after query execution.

# Measuring Page Load Time:
**1. Using Browser Developer Tools:**

      Open your application in a web browser.
      Right-click on the page, select "Inspect" to open Developer Tools.
      Navigate to the "Network" tab.
      Reload the page (Ctrl + R or Cmd + R).
      Look for the timing information, especially "DOMContentLoaded" and "load" events in the "Timing" section. The "load" event represents the overall page load time.
